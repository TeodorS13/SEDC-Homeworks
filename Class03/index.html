    <b>Facebook</b> is an online social media and social networking service owned by
    American technology giant Meta Platforms. Created in 2004 by Mark
    Zuckerberg with four other Harvard College students and roommates Eduardo
    Saverin, Andrew McCollum, Dustin Moskovitz, and Chris Hughes, its name
    derives from the face book directories often given to American university
    students. Membership was initially limited to Harvard students, gradually
    expanding to other North American universities. Since 2006, Facebook
    allows everyone to register from 13 years old (or older), except in the
    case of a handful of nations, where the age limit is 14 years.[6] As of
    December 2022, Facebook claimed 3 billion monthly active users,[7] and
    ranked third worldwide among the most visited websites.[8] It was the most
    downloaded mobile app of the 2010s.[9] Facebook can be accessed from
    devices with Internet connectivity, such as personal computers, tablets
    and smartphones. After registering, users can create a profile revealing
    information about themselves. They can post text, photos and multimedia
    which are shared with any other users who have agreed to be their "friend"
    or, with different privacy settings, publicly. Users can also communicate
    directly with each other with Messenger, join common-interest groups, and
    receive notifications on the activities of their Facebook friends and the
    pages they follow.

    <b>TikTok</b>, whose mainland Chinese counterpart is Douyin[3] (Chinese: 抖音; pinyin: Dǒuyīn), is a short-form video
    hosting service owned by ByteDance.[4] It hosts user-submitted videos, which can range in duration from 3 seconds to
    10 minutes.

    Since their launches, TikTok and Douyin have gained global popularity.[6][7] In October 2020, TikTok surpassed 2
    billion mobile downloads worldwide.[8][9][10] Morning Consult named TikTok the third-fastest growing infotech brand
    of 2020, after Zoom and Peacock.[11] Cloudflare ranked TikTok the most popular website of 2021, surpassing
    Google.[12] TikTok's popularity has resulted in the platform having an increasing cultural impact world wide.

    <b>Instagram</b> is an American photo and video sharing social networking service owned by Meta Platforms. It allows users to upload media that can be edited with filters, be organized by hashtags, and be associated with a location via geographical tagging. Posts can be shared publicly or with preapproved followers. Users can browse other users' content by tags and locations, view trending content, like photos, and follow other users to add their content to a personal feed.[11]

    Instagram was originally distinguished by allowing content to be framed only in a square (1:1) aspect ratio of 640 pixels to match the display width of the iPhone at the time. In 2015, this restriction was eased with an increase to 1080 pixels. It also added messaging features, the ability to include multiple images or videos in a single post, and a Stories feature—similar to its main competitor Snapchat—which allowed users to post their content to a sequential feed, with each post accessible to others for 24 hours. As of January 2019, Stories is used by 500 million people daily.[11]
    
    Originally launched for iOS in October 2010 by Kevin Systrom and Mike Krieger, Instagram rapidly gained popularity, with one million registered users in two months, 10 million in a year, and 1 billion by June 2018. In April 2012, Facebook Inc. acquired the service for approximately US$1 billion in cash and stock. The Android version was released in April 2012, followed by a feature-limited desktop interface in November 2012, a Fire OS app in June 2014, and an app for Windows 10 in October 2016. As of October 2015, over 40 billion photos had been uploaded. Although often admired for its success and influence, Instagram has also been criticized for negatively affecting teens' mental health, its policy and interface changes, its alleged censorship, and illegal and inappropriate content uploaded by users.
